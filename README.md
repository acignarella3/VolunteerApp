# VolunteerApp

VolunteerApp is a mobile-friendly web application that allows event organizers to manage events, jobs/booths, and workers/volunteers. My team, comprised of myself, Christina Kirkman, Don Geldbach, Reed Rosser, and Ricardo Macias, created it for our Capstone project in the Summer 2016 semester. We created it using AngularJS on the front-end, Firebase on the back-end, and Phone Gap to allow compatibility with Android and iOS devices.
